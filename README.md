# MENACE
MENACE - Machine Educable Noughts and Crosses Engine, is a self-learning tic-tac-toe engine developed by Donald Mitchie in 1961. He originally conceived of the idea using matchboxes to represent the game states and beads to represent the different playable positions for each game state. The distribution of the beads in each matchbox dictates the probability for each move, and consequently, changes to this distribution is what enables MENACE to learn.   

It was one of the first self-learning machines and this repository provides a pure C++ implementation of the project while keeping true to the original idea of matchbox and beads.
